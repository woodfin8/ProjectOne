# Finding Restaurant Franchise Growth Opportunities
Brendan, Gargi, Sarah and Keith

This set of programs aim to figure out which major franchises are worth openning new locations in which cities. Eight major American franchises were chosen.

- Yelp review data was used to indicate how general consumers enjoyed currently opened locations based on number of reviews and the average star rating for that storefront.
- Google search data was collected via API in order to figure out how often google users from various american cities were looking up these eight franchises the past two years. This information was utilized to predict where a new location for a franchise may be well received.
- Lastly, US Census Data was collected via the census API to determine which american cities would be the most advantageous to open new franchise locations.

### Setting Up the Program
- To access the data used in this project, a Google API and US Census API Key are necessary.
